DukeSafety iOS App
================

This is an open-source college campus safety app, that grabs a user's location which can be sent to police/friend/security in case of emergencies from their iPhone/iPad. It was built by Tucker Albert and Soroush Pour for the Drew Everson Memorial Safety Challenge at Duke University 2013, sponsored by Pi Kappa Phi Mu Chapter.

##Currently it has the following functionality:

 * A user (eg. a student) opens the app when feeling unsafe on campus
 * The app grabs the user's location
 * The user can send their location to the emergency services programmed into the app. At the moment, an email in the source code receives the user's location as a link to Google maps with the GPS coordinates

 This would work well on a large campus where GPS coordinates would be helpful in finding a user in danger.

##Future features could include:

 * A sign up page on first login to get more details about the user so these can be sent along with the user location to police or other emergency services
 * Instead of a single email with the location, the app could continually send the location to the emergency services
 * Ability for the user to set other emails/phone numbers to contact in case of emergency rather than a single pre-programmed email
 * Other safety features such as helpful campus map routing or a siren to alert nearby people

 It is not limited to college campuses and could be used really in any situation where you'd want a user to send their location to a central HQ. Feel free to modify the code as necessary to suit your needs.
